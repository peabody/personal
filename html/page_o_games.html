  <p>This is my little shrine to various classic computer
  games.</p>

  <h2>Doom</h2>

  <p>Ah, Doom. Who could forget those years spent blasting zombies
  in flickering corridors? Still want to play this game? Here are
  some resources.</p>

  <h2>Nethack</h2>

  <p>The impossible dungeon crawler nethack. Fun yet stupidly
  difficult. I've never beat it, and I don't think I ever will,
  life's too short.</p>

  <h2>Mega Man</h2>

  <h2>Tetris</h2>

  <h2>Castlevania</h2>

  <h2>Lemmings</h2>

  <h2>Zork</h2>

  <h2>Scott Adams Adventure Games</h2>
