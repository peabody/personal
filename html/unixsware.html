    <h1>Shell Accounts and Software</h1>
    <p>So you've got a shell account on someone's machine but you don't
    have root access and they don't have the software installed that you
    need?  What can you do?  Simple.  Provided you have the diskspace,
    you can install software into your user folder.  Here's how.</p> 

    <h3>Step 1</h3>

    <p>Download and extract the tar ball somewhere.  If the unix shell
    account you're using has your home folder mounted via nfs, it's nicer
    to actually extract it into /tmp.</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>

    <p>Configure the package so that it will install into your home
    folder.  If the source package uses the GNU autoconf tools you
    should be able to do this from the configure script <tt>./configure
      --prefix=/path/to/folder/to/install</tt></p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>

    <p><tt>make && make install</tt>.  If everything went smoothly,
    you should now be able to change your environment variables.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>

    <p>Change your environment varibles.  Set your PATH so that the bin
    folder of the folder you installed to is accessible.  If your
    software installed a shared library, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that it
    includes the /lib/&lt;softwarename> folder.  This should do it, you
    can run the new software.</p>
