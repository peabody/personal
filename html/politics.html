    Sad, but true.  Beansworth said it best on reddit:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <em>McCain doesn't care what picture you see. He doesn't know
	where what [sic] Spain is, Thinks Iraq and Pakistan share a
	border, sings songs about bombing Iran, thinks Czechoslovakia is
	still a country, forgets how many houses he owns, doesn't know
	what a condom is for, picked an incompetent, fundamentalist
	nutbag from the middle of nowhere for his running mate, condems
	Obama's supposed celebrity and yet he parties with movie stars,
	and contradicts his own platform at least twice a day, and his
	numbers don't go down. At this point, McCain could be
	photographed snorting coke off Osama bin Laden's ass while
	sacrificing a baby to Satan and he'd still be polling at
	48%.</em>
