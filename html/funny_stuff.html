  <h1>Funny Stuff with Free/Open Source Software</h1>

  <p>Often I find the real appeal of Free and Open Source software
  is its humanity, as demonstrated in the humerous witicism hidden
  throughout it's nooks crannies.</p>

  <h3>Emacs</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Try evaluating this in your scratch buffer with Emacs:
    (use-global-map (make-sparse-keymap)). Instantly unusable Emacs
    :-D. Reference: <a href=

    http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/religion/poor-mans-vi-mode.html</a></li>

    <li>If you've never read the Antinews for Emacs, you should,
    it's a kick. It's a sarcastic tongue-in-cheek listing of
    previous Emacs features as "upgrades" should you wish to use a
    previous version of Emacs. <tt><b>M-x info g Emacs &lt;ENT&gt;
    m Antinews</b></tt>.</li>
  </ul>
