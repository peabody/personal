    <h1>Regular Expressions</h1>

    <div id="toc"></div>

    <h2>The world of REs</h2>

    <p>Regular Expressions are so much trouble in Unix that I wrote
    this page just to talk about them. Namely I show what they are,
    how many different versions there are, and how to deal with
    them.</p>

    <p>Regular Expressions can be used for pattern matching of strings.
    In particular, they're limited to recognizing regular grammars.  I
    don't use the word text because they can be used for any kind of
    binary string (though they are mostly used for text). The killer-app
    of regular expressions is their ability to extract information from
    somewhat arbitrarily structured data, such as the text on a web
    page.</p>

    <p>They have advantages and disadvantages. Jamie Zawinski has a
    famous quote regarding regular expressions <em>Some people, when
      they have a problem, think "I know! I'll use regular expressions!"
      Now they have two problems.</em> The immortal truth behind this
    quote is that regular expressions are used far more often than they
    should be. People have written parsers in regular expressions.
    Don't do that, it's a terrible idea.  You want to use an actual
    parser for that, one based on a BNF grammar.</p>

    <p>Regular expressions are also typically inefficient. Regular
    expression searches are an exhaustive search. In algorithmic terms
    this means that they're a brute force kludge. Put simply, the
    algorithm scans stupidly until it finds a solution and if one isn't
    found, it backtracks and tries other options until a solution is
    found or all choices have been exhausted</p>

    <p>That said however, regular expressions are the best tool for
    the job sometimes. In particular, they're used like crazy in
    text editors. Any text editor that has syntax
    color-highlighting probably uses regular expressions
    extensively (I know for a fact that both Vim and Emacs use
    regular expressions to figure out how the text in a program
    should be colored). This is because it is a lot more efficient
    to use regular expressions around a neighborhood of lines
    rather than to completely re-parse a document from scratch each
    time a change is made to it.</p>

    <p>The trouble with regular expressions that this article
    intends to discuss is their arbitrary syntax. I grew up on Perl
    regular expressions when I was 18 and I loved them. Before
    Perl, the only programming languages I had any experience with
    were BASIC, C++, and JavaScript. The ease with which you could
    describe the structure of textual data for extraction purposes
    was magical to me. I'd never seen something so powerful before.
    They were the reason I loved Perl as much as I did in my early
    days. However, once I began to venture past Perl as the only
    Unix tool I was familiar with, I began to realize that the
    state of standardized regular expressions was a mess. I was
    horrified.</p>

    <p>There are three camps of regular expressions: <strong>Perl's
    regular expressions</strong> (used by quite a few programs
    including python and apache; apache even uses Perl's exact
    implementation if it's compiled with it), <strong>extended
    regular expressions</strong> (which are similar to Perl's but
    often don't have all of its functionality) and <strong>basic
    regular expressions</strong> which are a very old kind of
    regular expressions used in the early Unix days (their
    functionality is extremely limited and they are a true
    nightmare to be stuck with. However, they're the default on
    utilities such as grep and sed. Thankfully, there are options
    to use more powerful regular expressions with these tools on
    most implementations today).</p>

    <p>If that wasn't bad enough, each individual program's
    implementation often has subtle quirks to its syntax.</p>

    <h2>Metacharacters</h2>

    <p>There are different metacharacters for different regular
    expression implementations. Here are the lists:</p>

    <h2>Perl and extended regular expressions</h2>

    <p>?+*|&amp;{}[]^$()</p>

    <h2>Basic regular expressions</h2>

    <p>*\|\&amp;\{\}[]^$\(\)</p>

    <p>As can be seen, all metacharacters need to be backslash
    escaped with the exception of *,^, $, [, \.</p>

    <h2>Character Classes</h2>

    <p>Character classes differ greatly between regular expression
    implementations. Let us start with basic regular
    expressions...they're aren't any. There, that was easy.</p>

    <p>Extended regular expressions introduced the idea of custom
    character classes. Here's a list of them (these's aren't available in Vim
    or Emacs):</p>

    <pre>
     [[:alnum:]]  - [A-Za-z0-9]     Alphanumeric characters
     [[:alpha:]]  - [A-Za-z]        Alphabetic characters
     [[:blank:]]  - [ \x09]         Space or tab characters only
     [[:cntrl:]]  - [\x00-\x19\x7F] Control characters
     [[:digit:]]  - [0-9]           Numeric characters
     [[:graph:]]  - [!-~]           Printable and visible characters
     [[:lower:]]  - [a-z]           Lower-case alphabetic characters
     [[:print:]]  - [ -~]           Printable (non-Control) characters
     [[:punct:]]  - [!-/:-@[-`{-~]  Punctuation characters
     [[:space:]]  - [ \t\v\f]       All whitespace chars
     [[:upper:]]  - [A-Z]           Upper-case alphabetic characters
     [[:xdigit:]] - [0-9a-fA-F]     Hexadecimal digit characters
    
</pre>

    <p>Then there's Perl style character classes. Note: all of
    these <B>are</B> available in Vim and Emacs regular expressions.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>\w any word character (depends on locale setting,
      available in egrep)</li>

      <li>\W any non-word character (depends on locale setting,
      available in egrep)</li>

      <li>\d any digit</li>

      <li>\D any non-digit</li>

      <li>\b any word boundary</li>

      <li>\s any whitespace character</li>

      <li>\S any non-whitespace character</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The replacement (that "s" thingy)</h2>

    <p>There are some important details to know about the
    replacement side of the pattern. Almost everything is included
    literally, so you don't need to worry about many
    metacharacters. Only &amp; and backreferences of the form
    \DIGIT are things to worry about. If you need to include an
    &amp; then make sure to backslash escape it. If you need to
    include a literal \DIGIT form, us a double backslash.</p>

    <h2>Programs that use regular expressions</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>grep (basic per default, egrep uses extended re's)</li>

      <li>find (depends on Unix version.  Basic re in BSD, Emacs re on
      GNU/Linux, which is kind of a weird melding of basic and extended.
      However, in both cases, a full match is done, so the pattern space must
      be designed to match the entire filename)</li>

      <li>sed (basic per default, option to use extended re's in
      certain versions, use -E flag on bsd, -r flag on GNU/Linux)</li>

      <li>awk (extended re's)</li>

      <li>vi/vim (normal vi only has basic re's, vim has a
      variation of Perl re, but metacharacters behave like basic
      re's)</li>

      <li>Emacs (metacharacters need to be escaped like basic re's,
      however, there are Perl-like character classes).</li>

      <li>apache (Perl re's if compiled in, basic otherwise)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Programming languages that use regular expressions
    frequently</h2>

    <p>Note: I suppose awk is considered a programming language by
    some, but I'm leaving it out of this list since it was listed
    above. These all pretty much use Perl re's with some of their
    own variations.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Perl</li>

      <li>Python</li>

      <li>PHP</li>

      <li>Ruby</li>
    </ul>
