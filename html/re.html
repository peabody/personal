    <h1>Regular Expressions</h1>

    <div id="toc"></div>

    <h2>The world of REs</h2>

    <p>Regular Expressions are so varied in Unix that I wrote this
    page just to keep track of them. Namely I show what they are, and
    some of the different versions in existence.  This page isn't
    meant to be an exhaustive reference (nor even accurate).</p>

    <p>Regular Expressions can be used for pattern matching of
    strings.  In particular, they're limited to recognizing regular
    grammars.  I don't use the word text because they can be used for
    any kind of binary string (though they are mostly used for text).
    Some of the most common uses of regular expressions are data
    validation in web applications and extraction of data from
    informally structured input.</p>

    <p>Regular expressions have advantages and disadvantages. Jamie
    Zawinski has a famous quote which states: <em>Some
    people, when they have a problem, think "I know! I'll use regular
    expressions!"  Now they have two problems.</em> The point of the
    quote is that regular expressions are used far more often than
    they should be. People have written parsers in regular
    expressions.  Don't do that, it's a terrible idea.  You want to
    use an actual parser for that, one based on a BNF grammar.</p>

    <p>Regular expressions are also typically inefficient.
    Algorithmically they are an exhaustive backtracking search of all
    solutions. Put simply, the regular expression algorithms scan
    stupidly until they find a solution and if one isn't found, it
    backtracks and tries other options until a solution is found or
    all choices have been exhausted</p>

    <p>That said however, regular expressions are the best tool for
    the job sometimes. They're the most common form of input
    validation in web applications.  They work great for
    programatically extracting data from web pages.  They're also used
    in text editors, particularly editors that have syntax
    color-highlighting.</p>

    <h2>Syntax Families</h2>

    <p>I grew up on Perl regular expressions when I was 18 and I loved
    them. Before Perl, the only programming languages I had any
    experience with were BASIC, C++, and JavaScript. The ease with
    which you could describe the structure of textual data for
    extraction purposes was magical to me. I'd never seen something so
    powerful before.  They were the reason I loved Perl as much as I
    did in my early days. However, once I began to venture past Perl
    as the only Unix tool I was familiar with, I began to realize that
    the state of standardized regular expressions was a mess. I was
    horrified.</p>

    <p>There are three camps of regular expressions: <strong>Perl's
    regular expressions</strong> (used by quite a few programs
    including python and apache; apache even uses Perl's exact
    implementation if it's compiled with it), <strong>extended regular
    expressions</strong> (which are similar to Perl's but don't have
    all of its functionality) and <strong>basic regular
    expressions</strong> which are a very old kind of regular
    expression used in the early Unix days.  Their functionality is
    extremely limited and it's frustrating to be stuck with
    them. However, they're the default on utilities such as grep and
    sed. Thankfully, there are options to use more powerful regular
    expressions with these tools on most implementations today.</p>

    <p>If that wasn't bad enough, each individual program's
    implementation often has subtle quirks to its own syntax.</p>

    <h2>Metacharacters</h2>

    <p>Metacharacters have functional meanings in a regular
    expression.  I don't define them here.  These lists are so that I
    can reference what characters I may or may not need to escape.</p>

    <h2>Perl and extended regular expressions</h2>

    <p>?+*|&amp;{}[]^$()</p>

    <h2>Basic regular expressions</h2>

    <p>*\|\&amp;\{\}[]^$\(\)\<\></p>

    <p>As can be seen, all metacharacters need to be backslash
    escaped with the exception of *,^, $, [, \.</p>

    <h2>Character Classes</h2>

    <p>Character classes differ greatly between regular expression
    implementations. Let us start with basic regular
    expressions...there aren't any. There, that was easy.</p>

    <p>Extended regular expressions introduced the idea of custom
    character classes. Below is a list of them.  The left-hand side of
    this table are patterns available in extended regular expressions,
    but not in Perl.  The right hand side are classes available
    everywhere:</p>

    <pre>
     [[:alnum:]]  - [A-Za-z0-9]     Alphanumeric characters
     [[:alpha:]]  - [A-Za-z]        Alphabetic characters
     [[:blank:]]  - [ \x09]         Space or tab characters only
     [[:cntrl:]]  - [\x00-\x19\x7F] Control characters
     [[:digit:]]  - [0-9]           Numeric characters
     [[:graph:]]  - [!-~]           Printable and visible characters
     [[:lower:]]  - [a-z]           Lower-case alphabetic characters
     [[:print:]]  - [ -~]           Printable (non-Control) characters
     [[:punct:]]  - [!-/:-@[-`{-~]  Punctuation characters
     [[:space:]]  - [ \t\v\f]       All whitespace chars
     [[:upper:]]  - [A-Z]           Upper-case alphabetic characters
     [[:xdigit:]] - [0-9a-fA-F]     Hexadecimal digit characters
    
</pre>

    <p>Below I list Perl style character classes. All of
    these <B>are</B> available in Vim.  The functionality of these
    classes depend largely on your locale
    setting. <span style="font-size: 8pt">(*these are available in
    Emacs).</span>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>\w any word character*</li>

      <li>\W any non-word character*</li>

      <li>\d any digit</li>

      <li>\D any non-digit</li>

      <li>\b any word boundary*</li>

      <li>\s any whitespace character</li>

      <li>\S any non-whitespace character</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Replacement Metacharacters in the Substitution Command</h2>

    <p>There are some important metacharacters to know about regarding
    the replacement text in substitution commands. Almost everything
    is included literally, so you don't need to worry about many
    metacharacters. Only &amp; and backreferences of the form \DIGIT
    are things to worry about. If you need to include an &amp; then
    make sure to backslash escape it. If you need to include a literal
    \DIGIT form, us a double backslash.</p>

    <h2>Matching vs Searching</h2>

    <p>I've noticed this terminology is fairly standard among the use
    of regular expressions in programming languages.  Matching usually
    means "to find a pattern that matches the whole string" and
    searching means "to find a pattern that matches part (or all) of
    the string."  The difference is subtle.  If you ever get confused,
    think of matching as implicitly wrapping your pattern with ^ and
    $.</p>

    <h2>Popular Programs that Use Regular Expressions</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>grep -- basic per default, egrep uses extended re's</li>

      <li>find -- depends on Unix version.  Basic re in BSD, Emacs re on
      GNU/Linux, which is kind of a weird melding of basic and extended.
      However, in both cases, a matching is done, so the pattern space must
      be designed to match the entire filename</li>

      <li>sed -- basic per default, option to use extended re's in
      certain versions, use -E flag on bsd, -r flag on GNU/Linux</li>

      <li>awk -- extended re's</li>

      <li>vi/vim -- normal vi only has basic re's, vim has a
      variation of Perl re's, but metacharacters behave like basic
      re's</li>

      <li>Emacs -- Metacharacters need to be escaped like basic re's,
      and there are only some Perl-like character classes.  There are
      special classes which reference cultural writing systems and
      entries in Emacs's syntax table.</li>

      <li>apache -- Perl re's if compiled in, basic otherwise</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Popular Programming Languages That Have Regular Expression
    Syntax or Libraries</h2>

    <p>Note: I suppose awk is considered a programming language by
    some, but I'm leaving it out of this list since it was listed
    above. These languages use Perl re's (not necessarily Perl's
    implementation) with some of their own variations.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Perl</li>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>PHP</li>
      <li>Ruby</li>
      <li>Java</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
