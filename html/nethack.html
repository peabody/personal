  <p>I love nethack, bitch of a game though it may be. This is my
  list of patches I use as well as my installation instructions on
  different platforms.</p>

  <h2>Patches</h2>

  <p>Here are several patches I use with my nethack. None of the
  patches effects the game balance, they simply provide a better
  user interface experience on terminals, which is the way Ghad
  intended to play nethack.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>hpmon -- monitors your hit points by coloring them green,
    yellow or red.</li>

    <li>menucolors -- highlights menu items based on regular
    expressions. Commonly used to highlight items in your inventory
    based on their B/C/U status.</li>

    <li>my unified diff</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Mac OS X</h2>

  <p>Mac OS X seems to have the most involved installation
  instructions. Most of this seems related to the fact that Mac OS
  X doesn't come with GNU regex and I like to use the menucolors
  and hpmon patches.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Unzip</b></li>

    <li><b>cd nethack-x.x.x; run patches (patch -p0 &lt;
    ../patchname)</b></li>

    <li><b>Edit config.h. Change the following.</b></li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are patches here to automate the procedure.</p>

  <h2>Linux</h2>

  <h2>Windows</h2>

  <h2>Acronyms</h2>

  <p>This section is stolen verbatim from the r.g.r.n faq.</p>

  <p>YAAP: Yet Another Ascension Post<br>
  YAFAP: Yet Another First Ascension Post.<br>
  Someone has completed a game of NetHack (possibly for the first
  time) and wants to brag/show off. Finishing NetHack is not a
  trivial accomplishment, so some bragging is probably called for
  (see 2.8).</p>

  <p>YASD: Yet Another Stupid Death.<br>
  YAAD: Yet Another Annoying Death.<br>
  Get used to this phenomenon if you're going to play NetHack.
  Someone has died in a particularly amusing or annoying way, and
  wants pity for his or her stupidity or a shoulder to cry on.</p>

  <p>YAFM: Yet Another Funny Message.<br>
  YAFMC: Yet Another Funny Message Combination<br>
  YAFP: Yet Another Funny Prompt<br>
  Sometimes, the messages NetHack gives you are amusing, or have a
  strange juxtaposition of several messages or an odd mix of
  inventory letters. Someone has found a message or combination
  that they liked.</p>

  <p>YANI: Yet Another New (Nifty) Idea (Item).<br>
  Someone has an idea for an improvement or addition to the
  game.</p>

  <p>DYWYPI?: Do You Want Your Possessions Identified?<br>
  The first question NetHack asks you if you are killed. Many
  posters use it as shorthand for "And then the
  &lt;monster/trap/stupid move/typo&gt; killed me."</p>

  <p>The DevTeam:<br>
  The DevTeam is the group of programmers responsible for the
  maintenance and development of NetHack. Remember: The DevTeam
  Think of Everything! (TDTTOE!)</p>

  <p>The RNG: Random Number Generator -or- Random NetHack God.<br>
  Every game of NetHack is different, thanks to the effects of the
  random numbers used in the creation of the dungeon. Sometimes it
  seems like the random numbers have a malicious will of their own
  and are therefore personified, as in "The RNG was especially
  cruel to me today."</p>
