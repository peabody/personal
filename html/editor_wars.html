    <h2>A Tale of Two Editors</h2>

    <p>This page is my own take on the so-called "Editor Wars". For
    those who don't know what the Editor Wars are, here's an
    explanation. Unix geeks have historically had one very
    important job: editing text. Unix was originally devised as a
    system to help with text processing (among it's other duties)
    and the most important tool on Unix became the text editor as a
    consequence. Among text editors, two factions emerged: vi and
    Emacs.</p>

    <p>Vi was the first visual text editor available on Unix. It
    was written by Bill Joy in 1976 for Berkeley Unix and became
    the standard text editor shipped with System V Unix. Several
    free clones of vi were made over the years and today's crowned
    champion is Vim, an acronym for Vi IMproved.</p>

    <p>Emacs started life as a bunch of text macros for the MIT AI
    lab's text editor TECO. Several evolutions of Emacs popped up
    on different machines later on, including Unix, all written by
    different people. The most popular version today is GNU
    Emacs.</p>

    <p>To get an idea of how heated the debate gets, here are a few
    quotes:</p>

    <blockquote>
      #Need to find some good quotes.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Why all the hysteria over text editors? My theory is that
    it's largely due to the fact that learning these programs is
    much like learning a musical instrument. Namely, it takes a lot
    of time and practice. Once you've spent the time to learn one,
    having to learn where the other editor has hidden all its
    features is an exercise in frustration. Especially when they
    share so many features in common:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Multi-level Undo</li>

      <li>Advanced search and replace with regular expressions</li>

      <li>"Delete then paste" functionality (kill/yank vs
      delete/yank/put)</li>

      <li>Registers which save text and file positions to be called
      later</li>

      <li>Syntax aware commands for editing source code</li>

      <li>Syntax color highlighting</li>

      <li>Fast navigation via the keyboard</li>

      <li>Ability to work with multiple files</li>

      <li>Ability to compile source code and check syntax
      errors</li>

      <li>Ability to compose documentation such as man pages and
      texinfo easily</li>

      <li>Ability to reduce typing via shortcuts (abbreviations,
      and keyboard macros)</li>

      <li>Complete user customizability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Seeing as there is a dramatic overlap in functionality, one
    can perhaps see how dogmatic arguments came about surrounding
    these softwares. Since they solve the same kinds of tasks, they
    do things slightly differently, and as the proverb says "It's
    the differences that make things interesting."</p>

    <h2>Contrasting the two</h2>

    <h2>Modal vs Modeless Editing</h2>

    <p>The most pronounced philosophical difference between the two
    editors starts with how text is entered into them. Vi is a
    modal editor. Emacs is modeless. Most editors in the world
    today are Modeless. What this means is that the editor is
    designed to enter text right away. As soon as the user types on
    the keyboard, he or she is entering text into the document at
    hand. To give the editor commands, modifier keys or pointing
    devices, such as the control button and a mouse, are applied to
    a key to send a command. Modal editing, on the other hand,
    means that the editor switches between the state of inserting
    text and taking commands. This means that buttons on the
    keyboard normally used for entering text are occupied for
    instructing the editor to do things in command mode.</p>

    <p>There are merits to both approaches. Modeless editing is
    more intuitive, which is probably why it is the style of
    editing employed by almost every text editing application,
    professional or otherwise, on every computer platform in
    existence. It's disadvantages are that its keyboard shortcuts
    are usually much longer and harder to memorize and aren't typed
    as quickly. Modal editing, on the other hand, has a learning
    curve and takes work. However, once it's mastered, editing is
    extremely quick and the commands are easier to memorize.</p>

    <p>Having mastered both Vim and Emacs, which do I prefer? That
    depends on the task at hand. If I have to compose a document or
    start a document from scratch I prefer the modeless style of
    editing. If most of your time will be spent inserting new text,
    then many of the speed benefits of modal editing are bound by
    your thoughts and typing, not the keyboard commands. However,
    if I have to make vast changes to a document which will mostly
    consist of rearranging text or changing a few lines of text, I
    prefer modal.</p>

    <h2>Size Matters</h2>

    <p>The weight and memory footprint of the editors has also been
    an issue of debate.</p>

    <h2>Subtle Differences</h2>

    <p>Both editors have registers. Both editors store their
    deletions into structures that can paste them back. Vim does it
    with numbered registers, Emacs does it with the kill-ring. Vim
    stores cursor locations in registers. Emacs has the
    mark-ring.</p>

    <h2>Practical Considerations</h2>

    <p>Other than design considerations, there are practical
    considerations to take into account. For example, Emacs has a
    long startup time. This isn't considered a problem by most of
    its users because the Emacs work philosophy is that the user
    should launch it once and keep it running, using it to perform
    all of their work. I do this. When I first sit down at a Unix
    machine, and sometimes a Windows and Macintosh machine to do
    work, I usually start Emacs and keep it running for the
    duration of my time spent on that machine.</p>

    <p>There is a problem with this, however. Unix system
    administration requires obtaining the administrative privilege,
    or root account, to perform any work. If Emacs is started under
    a normal user account, there isn't a practical way to obtain
    the root account privilege.</p>

    <p>One could simply use Emacs under their own user account for
    personal work, and launch a separate Emacs when needed..
    However, this is undesirable for the reasons stated above; it
    takes too long to get Emacs up and running.</p>

    <p>One could simply launch Emacs as root to begin with, but
    this has several problems with it. First of all, a user's own
    personal work should be under their own user account, but if
    they launch Emacs as root, any files it creates will be under
    the root user. Secondly, Emacs was a program never built with
    security in mind. A stock Emacs without user customizations is
    fairly secure, but who knows how many of the elisp packages and
    customizations have been scrutinized for security? Lastly,
    running an interactive user program under the root user is
    extremely dangerous, as root is God under Unix and any fatal,
    system-ending mistake will be permitted under the account
    without any confirmation.</p>

    <p>A solution to this is to run two different Emacs processes,
    one under the root account, and one under the normal user. This
    has problems as well. It would be fairly easy to confuse the
    two, and certain Emacs packages run the risk of conflicting
    with each other. It also uses twice the memory, and Emacs is
    already heavy enough as it is.</p>

    <p>Yet another solution to this thorny problem is to use one of
    the remote file access packages of Emacs. The default of Emacs
    21 is ange-ftp. This package permits accessing files on ftp
    servers over the Internet. If one were to run an ftp server
    which permitted a root login through the localhost, then the
    ftp services can be used as a clever proxy to root privileges
    on the system. However, this is extremely unsafe. Even if one
    limits the root login to being available only through the
    loopback device, it's asking for trouble. It also requires that
    the root account be enabled, which violates the default
    security policies of distros like Ubuntu.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the best solution found so far is the Tramp package.
    Tramp is a new remote file access package which will come
    bundled with Emacs 22. For now it can be downloaded off the
    Internet. Tramp has a "sudo" method, which allows tramp to talk
    to sudo to read and write files. This requires that the
    administrator have access through sudo, but this is a very
    common setup these days (and a good one as it provides an audit
    trail for root executed commands).</p>

    <p>Vim, of course, has historically never had this problem as
    users typically launch it from a shell with sudo or from a su
    login to get their root privileges. In other words, it's not a
    problem in that it doesn't conflict with vim's typical usage
    pattern.</p>
